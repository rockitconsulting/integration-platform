# IIB-Monitor


The current configuration of IIB applications and IIB runtime environments is output by the IIB-Monitor application. 
This enables a control of deployments, broker / execution group / application configurations.


In the application, the broker infrastructure information is read and written in JSON format to a file and an MQ queue. The output includes:

* Broker runtime attributes - name, version, status (running / stopped), operating system etc.
* ExecutionGroup runtime attributes - name, status (running / stopped), etc.
* Application/flow attributes - name, status (running / stopped), properties etc.
* Configurable Services, HTTP Connectors, MQ Queues and other infrastructure objects.

The application consists of 2 MessageFlows:

## ReportingFlow.msgflow

![ReportingFlow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rockitconsulting/integration-platform/master/IIB-Monitor/IIB-Monitor/docs/img/ReportingFlow.PNG?raw=true)

In the flow ReportingFlow, the broker information is read, converted into a JSON message (report message) and output in a file and in an MQ queue.


## HTTPReportFlow.msgflow

![HTTPReportFlow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rockitconsulting/integration-platform/master/IIB-Monitor/IIB-Monitor/docs/img/HTTPReportFlow.PNG?raw=true)


The HTTPReportFlow flow provides the report message that was generated by the ReportingFlow flow as a JSON document in a browser. This flow is triggered by an HTTP call under a defined URL.
